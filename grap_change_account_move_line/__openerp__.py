Various Change in Account Move Lines Generation
===============================================
Point Of Sale:
--------------
    * Store the taxes in pos_orders like for sale_orders so that the created
      account moves keep the good tax even if the product is changed between
      the sale and the session closure; The Account Move will be valid in
      that case;


With this module, the account_move_lines (created when validating an invoice
or closing a POS session) will not be detailed by product if the
group_invoice_lines box is checked in the journal.
When you close a pos_session, it will create one account_move per day for
the sale + one account_move per payment mode.

The purpose of this module is to rewrite the awful _create_account_move_line
function of model pos_order, so that it can be easily modified by inheritance
in other modules


History:
--------
This module is the merge of:
* pos_tax;
* pos_rewrite_create_aml;
* account_group_move_lines;
